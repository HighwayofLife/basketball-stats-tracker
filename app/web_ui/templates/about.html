        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Basketball Stats Tracker uses a unique shot string format for efficient data entry:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shot Strings:</strong> Enter shots in the format "XY-Z" where:
                <ul>
                    <li>X = number of made shots</li>
                    <li>Y = shot type (2 for 2-pointers, 3 for 3-pointers)</li>
                    <li>Z = free throw results (x for makes, number for attempts)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> "22-1x" means 2 made 2-pointers, 1 missed 2-pointer, 1 made free throw, 1 missed free throw</li>
        </ul>
